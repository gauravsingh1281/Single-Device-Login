## üîê Single Device Login Authentication  
### Prevent Access from Multiple Devices Simultaneously

**Single Device Login Authentication** is a security mechanism that restricts user access to only **one device or browser at a time**.  

When a user logs in from a new device or browser, the previous session is automatically **invalidated and logged out**.  

This helps prevent **unauthorized access**, **account sharing**, and **piracy**, making it ideal for secure platforms like learning portals, admin dashboards, and content-based applications.
